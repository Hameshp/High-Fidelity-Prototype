## Basic High-Fidelity Prototype

This assignment[^1] allowed me to practice skills in high fidelity design, Web technology, __HTML__, __CSS__, __JavaScript__, and visual design principles.

1. Task One: Redesign the homepage for the book club by giving it better web styling and structure.
2. Task Two: 
      - Design a registration form for a new book club member.
      - The form should be in a modal window that pops up as an overlay on top of the homepage.
